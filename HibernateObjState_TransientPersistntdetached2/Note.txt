IT SAYS STILL THE POINT YOU PASS THE OBJECT TO SAVE FUNCTION, THE OBJECT IS SAID TO LIVE IN A STATE KNOWN
AS A TRANSIENT STATE
ONE YOU PASS THIS OBJECT TO SAVE FUNCTION RIGHT AFTER THAT, TILL THE POINT YOU CLOSE THE SESSION, THE
OBJECT IS SIAD TO LEAVE IN A STATE KNOWN AS PERSISTANT STATE.
AND WHATS GOOD THING ABOUT PERSISTANT STATE IS ONCE AN OBJECT IS INTO A PERSISTANT STATE, AFTER THAT IF
YOU MAKE ANY MODIFICATIONS TO THAT OBJECT THEN HIBERNATE WOULD MAKE SURE THAT IT WOUDL FIRE
AN UPDATE QUERY INORDER TO SINK THAT MODIFICATION WITH THE DATABASE RECORD.
